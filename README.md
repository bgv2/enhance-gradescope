# enhance-gradescope
An unofficial extension that makes the online assignment tool Gradescope easier to use.
Current features:
- Displaying the number of incomplete assignments (unsubmitted assignments that can still be submitted) for each course on the homepage
- When viewing submissions, the tab's title displays the actual assignment name instead of just "View Submission"
